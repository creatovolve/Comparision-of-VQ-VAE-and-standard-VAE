    "### A Comparative Study in Latent Representation Learning\n",
    "\n",

    "## 🎯 Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to **train and compare** two generative autoencoding models —  \n",
    "a **standard Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** and a **Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE)** —  \n",
    "using the **CIFAR-10** image dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both models aim to **learn compact latent representations** of natural images,  \n",
    "but they differ fundamentally in how the latent space is structured and optimized:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VAE** uses a *continuous* latent space, optimized via the reparameterization trick and a KL-divergence regularization term.  \n",
    "- **VQ-VAE** introduces a *discrete* latent space using **vector quantization**, enabling the model to represent images through a finite learned codebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we will:\n",
    "1. Train both models on CIFAR-10 images.  \n",

    "## 🧩 Why Compare VAE and VQ-VAE?\n",

    "- **VAE** is a classical approach that provides smooth latent interpolation but often suffers from blurry reconstructions.  \n",
    "- **VQ-VAE**, on the other hand, replaces the continuous latent space with a learned dictionary of embeddings, which can lead to sharper image reconstructions and more interpretable discrete codes.\n",
    "\n",
